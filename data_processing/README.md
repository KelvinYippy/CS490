THINGS TO DO:

- Under constants.py, you may see something like this:

```python
MAIN_PATH = "/Users/kelvinyip7/Desktop/Code/CS490/data"
```

Replace the beginning section, "/Users/kelvinyip7/Desktop/Code/CS490", with wherever you are storing this repository. This acts as the main path for where you are going to store your data.
