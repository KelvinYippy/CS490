# CPSC490 - EngagementApp

EngagementApp is a CPSC490 senior project that builds a system attempting to learn what makes for good public speaking in the hopes of being able to use this knowledge to grade real life engagement made by people while talking to a large audience.

The app is divided into three sections: data and data processing, a PyTorch Model, and the Engagement App itself. It is recommended to read the respective READMEs in each section to go through all the steps to have a successfully working Engagement App. The EngagementApp can be found [here](https://github.com/KelvinYippy/CPSC490_Engagement_App).

This is a python heavy repository, so the following tools may be of use:

[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[Pip3](https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-install-and-use-pip3/)

```bash
python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Once you have these two tools, head over to the READMEs found in the data, data_processing, and model folders, in order.
